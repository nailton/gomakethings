    <p>The page you're looking for was looted by pirates! (<em>Or more likely, I messed up and moved something on you - sorry!</em>)</p>

    <p>At this point, you have a few options:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Try <a href="search/">searching</a> for it.</li>
        <li>Become a pirate hunter and embark on a quest to reclaim the lost page.</li>
        <li>Give up and go make something awesome instead.</li>
    </ol>
